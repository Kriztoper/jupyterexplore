# Image Compression using Modified Singular Value Decomposition
(This project is extended from rameshputalapattu's original jupyterexplore repo)

This research is an image processing project in our Linear Algebra course: MATH 114.

Our research is about using Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) in compressing images where we proposed a new k-computation formula and a new qualitative metric in determining the effectiveness of compression using the "Image Compression Turing Test". Kindly read on the full paper in **Image Processing.pdf** for more info.

# jupyterexplore
Exploration of montecarlo method for calculation of Pi, svd for compression of images and some visualization in jupyter notebooks.
This notebook explores the following topics.
- Montecarlo calculation of Pi
- image compression of gray scale images using svd
- image compression of color images using svd
